        <h2>Tropical Forest</h2>

            Evergreen and deciduous species vary in a range of morphological and physiological characters. Generally,
            broad-leaved evergreen species have thicker leaves than deciduous species, with a larger volume of
            parenchyma and air spaces per unit leaf area.[2] They have larger leaf biomass per unit leaf area, and hence
            a lower specific leaf area. Construction costs do not differ between the groups.[citation needed] Evergreens
            have generally a larger fraction of total plant biomass present as leaves (LMF),[3] but they often have a
            lower rate of photosynthesis.<br><br>

            Deciduous trees shed their leaves usually as an adaptation to a cold or dry/wet season. Evergreen trees also
            lose leaves, but each tree loses its leaves gradually and not all at once. Most tropical rainforest plants
            are considered to be evergreens, replacing their leaves gradually throughout the year as the leaves age and
            fall, whereas species growing in seasonally arid climates may be either evergreen or deciduous. Most warm
            temperate climate plants are also evergreen.[citation needed] In cool temperate climates, fewer plants are
            evergreen. In this climate,[which?] there is a predominance of conifers because few evergreen broadleaf
            plants can tolerate severe cold below about −26 °C (−15 °F).<br><br>

            In areas where there is a reason for being deciduous, e.g. a cold season or dry season, evergreen plants are
            usually an adaptation of low nutrient levels. Additionally, they usually have hard leaves and have an
            excellent water economy due to scarce resources in the area in which they reside.[4] The excellent water
            economy within the evergreen species is due to high abundance when compared to deciduous species.[4] Whereas
            deciduous trees lose nutrients whenever they lose their leaves. In warmer areas, species such as some pines
            and cypresses grow on poor soils and disturbed ground. In Rhododendron, a genus with many broadleaf
            evergreens, several species grow in mature forests but are usually found on highly acidic soil where the
            nutrients are less available to plants. In taiga or boreal forests, it is too cold for the organic matter in
            the soil to decay rapidly, so the nutrients in the soil are less easily available to plants, thus favoring
            evergreens.<br><br>

            In temperate climates, evergreens can reinforce their own survival; evergreen leaf and needle litter has a
            higher carbon-nitrogen ratio than deciduous leaf litter, contributing to a higher soil acidity and lower
            soil nitrogen content. This is the case with Mediterranean evergreen seedlings, which have unique C and N
            storages that allow stored resources to determine fast growth within the species, limiting competition and
            bolstering survival.[5] These conditions favor the growth of more evergreens and make it more difficult for
            deciduous plants to persist. In addition, the shelter provided by existing evergreen plants can make it
            easier for younger evergreen plants to survive cold and/or drought.<br><br>

            evergreen, any plant that retains its leaves through the year and into the following growing season. Many
            tropical species of broad-leaved flowering plants are evergreen, but in cold-temperate and Arctic areas the
            evergreens commonly are cone-bearing shrubs or trees (conifers), such as pines and firs. The leaves of
            evergreens usually are thicker and more leathery than those of deciduous trees (those that shed their leaves
            in autumn or in the tropical dry season) and often are needlelike or scalelike in cone-bearing trees. A leaf
            may remain on an evergreen tree for two years or longer and may fall during any season. An evergreen forest
            may be needle-leaved, as the coniferous forests of the Northern Hemisphere, or broad-leaved, as the
            temperate rain forests of the Southern Hemisphere and the broad sclerophyll forests (with thickened,
            hardened foliage resistant to water loss) of coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Most tropical rain
            forests contain broad-leaved evergreens. See also coniferous forest; chaparral.<br><br>
